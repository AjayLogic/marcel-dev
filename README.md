Follow along by subscribing at [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/marceldempers)


This repository serves as a reference architecture for my micro service architecture. Currently supports the following components:

Composite UI's:
* Frame-service
* Header-service
* Content-service
* Footer-service

## Get our Docker container ready!

Use the bootstrap repository under the [architecture](./repositories/architecture) to get the platform up and running locally.

Requirements :

* Docker
* Docker-Compose
* Kubernetes (Coming soon!)
